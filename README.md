# HotlineSavela
Source code of a game prototype. Game can be played at http://a-suniala.github.io/projects/HLSDemo. 
Originally based on Sebastian Lague's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ctd4dgE1F8g3uec4zKNRV0. This repository does not include the whole project with all the assets, but just the source code. If you're willing to build something similar, I recommend Sebastian's excellent tutorial. 

Some of the features:
* Procedural map generation 
 * Seed support for maps, which guarantees same map structure on different plays
* Bullet-based damage system 
 * Damage is dealt based on actual bullet hits instead of just raycasting from weapon
* Instance-based audio player
* Sound library with support for playing randomized sound from an array of sounds dedicated to certain event
